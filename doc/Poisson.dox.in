/*! \mainpage Isogeometric FEM %Poisson application

\author Einar Christensen, SINTEF ICT, Trondheim

\section intro Introduction
This is a %Poisson application built on top of the IFEM library.
It solves the linear stationary %Poisson equation in a 1D, 2D or 3D domain,
subjected to an arbitrary heat source function and
Dirichlet as well as Neumann boundary conditions.
The application can also perform adaptive analysis, based on either
the exact error distributions (for problems with known analytical solution)
or recovery-based error estimates.

Refer to the document <i>doc/Integrands/Poisson.pdf</i>
for the underlying equations forming the basis of the integrand implementation
in the class Poisson.

IFEM is an object-oriented toolbox for implementing isogeometric finite element
(FE) solvers for linear and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs).
The toolbox is developed through the ICADA project at SINTEF ICT, Trondheim.
The purpose of this code is to serve as a common base for isogeometric
PDE-simulators, using splines and NURBS as basis functions in the FE
formulations. The toolbox contains methods for doing linear and nonlinear,
stationary and dynamic time-domain analyses, as well as eigenvalue analyses.
